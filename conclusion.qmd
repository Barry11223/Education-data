# Conclusion
The analysis of various data visualizations over a decade has provided significant insights into the educational attainment trends among black men and women. The main takeaway is the notable progress in higher education within the black community, with a particular emphasis on the increasing rates of bachelor's and higher degrees among both genders. However, a critical observation is the consistent and, in some cases, widening gap between black men and women, with women generally achieving higher levels of education.

Future directions should focus on understanding and addressing the underlying factors contributing to these gender disparities in educational attainment. Efforts must be directed towards ensuring equitable access to higher education for both black men and women, and exploring the reasons behind the different educational paths. This includes investigating the role of socioeconomic factors, support systems, and institutional barriers. Additionally, the impact of evolving educational methodologies, like online learning, should be further explored, especially in the context of their potential to democratize higher education access. Overall, while progress is evident, there is a clear need for continued support and strategic initiatives to bridge the educational gaps and foster comprehensive advancement in the black community's educational achievements.

However, there are some considerate limitation to the plots and their respective interpretation. First, the plots have a focus on the black data set, which results in very little vertical comparison such as a comparison between white male and black male. Besides the lack of reference to other races, another significant concern is the challenge in distinguishing correlation from causation; observed trends in educational attainment might not fully reveal the underlying causes, particularly the complex socio-economic and cultural factors at play. Additionally, the temporal scope of the data limits the ability to understand long-term trends, while the impact of external events like the pandemic may not be comprehensively captured. The choice of visualizations and their interpretation can also heavily influence conclusions, potentially overlooking subtleties in the data. Addressing these limitations is crucial for a more accurate and nuanced understanding of educational trends within the black community.
