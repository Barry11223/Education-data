    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe raw data we have acquired is already categorized by race, with further subdivisions by gender and age ranges within each racial group. To address our research questions effectively, we will need to develop additional methods to segment this data. This approach will allow us to create targeted plots from these refined subsets, providing clear and direct visual answers to our research inquiries. Here is how we use the data to answer the research questions:\n\nHow has the educational attainment varied across different age groups over the last decade?\n\nSubset the data by educational attainments; for each education attainment and a specific age range, get a data subset of how a range group’s specific education attainment changes across ten years\n\nWhich variables (age, gender, or race) play a statistically significant role in education attainment?\n\nCreate three separate subsets: one for each variable (age, gender, race). Within each subset, organize the data by different levels of educational attainment.\n\nHow has education of the high school level, the undergraduate level and other degrees changed across the decade at discussion?\n\nGroup the data by education attainment: within each attainment category, get the total population that belong to that category in each year of the ten years.\n\nThroughout the ten years, which race underwent the greatest change in education attainment? What does this implicate for the socio-economic dynamics of the United States?\n\nUse data that pertains to different races. Compare the distribution across different education attainment in each age range.\n\nDuring the time of COVID, were there drastic/noticeable changes in education attainment?\n\nFocus on the data from the years just before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Create subsets for each of these time periods and compare them to identify any significant changes in educational attainment that might be attributed to the pandemic’s impact.\n\nWhat do our plots implicate for the socio-economic dynamics of the United States? Or what potential policy direction is hinted at if there is any?\n\nThis question serves as a concluding question that we answer by aggregating our conclusion from previous plots."

To further explain, each heatmap contains the missing values from 2012 to 2021 for all races in each entry.\nIn our circumstances, a missing value may indicate that the Bureau didn’t collect any data of a particular entry. Another case is that number of people in an entry is less than 1000, so that the Bureau didn’t give a value for that entry because the entry less than 1000 will have a value of zero (the units in the original table is 1000).\nIn all three heatmaps, we can observe that there are lots of missing values for Doctoral degree and Professional degree for the year group of 18 to 24. This is reasonable because doctoral degree and professional degree took longer time to be granted, so that only a small group of people (less than 1000), which may produce a missing data. Besides, there are a small proportion of missing values in the up right corner of all three heatmaps, which is also reasonable because fewer people in the period of World War 2 may get a Doctoral or Professional Degree.\nThere are also consistent huge proportions of missing value in area below 12th grade for all age groups, indicating that a lot of people didn’t have a chance to go to high school across all years."
