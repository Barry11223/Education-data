    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nData used in this project is published by the United States Census Bureau, detailing the population’s education attainment across different race, gender, and age groups. We aim to use the education attainment data from 2012 to 2021 with a focus on the black population to delve into trends in education, dissecting the evolution of African American education during the last decade.\nEducation is fundamentally significant for a person’s development in the society. An overview of educational status of a particular subset of the society thus offers lenses through which we can understand broader socio-economic dynamics and challenges. By analyzing the education attainment data, we can identify patterns and disparities in educational access and achievements in specific demographic groups. This understanding can inform policy decisions, educational reforms, and targeted initiatives aimed at reducing educational inequalities and fostering a more inclusive and equitable society. Additionally, this analysis can highlight the progress or lack thereof in educational attainment, serving as a critical indicator of the nation’s development and its ability to adapt to the demands of black people as a minority group.\nSome interesting questions we seek to answer through our data visualizations:\n\nHow has the percentage of black male and female individuals with a Bachelor’s degree or higher changed from the decade of discussion? (Trend in Higher Education) How has the percentage of black male and female individuals with no education changed over the decade? (Trend in No Education History)\nWhat’s the trend for black males and females to have received a Doctoral degree over the decade for different age groups? (Doctoral Degree across Different Age Groups)\nHow do black males and females differ in percentages in education attainments? Can we find patterns from a year to year comparison? (Year to Year Education Attainment Comparison)\nOverall, how would one best describe the different paths in education development between black males and females over the ten year window? (Overall Education Development)\nDuring the time of COVID, were there drastic/noticeable patterns in education attainments? (COVID Impact on Education Attainment)\nWhat do our plots implicate for the socio-economic dynamics of the black population of the United States? Or what potential policy direction is hinted at if there is any?"

    "text": "2.1 Technical description\nWe found our “Education Attainment in the United States” data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s website. U.S. Census Bureau collected the data from the “Current Population Survey-Annual Social and Economic Supplement” and updated the Education Attainment data yearly. For the purpose of our project, we downloaded the Excel worksheets from the section “Table 1. Educational Attainment of the Population 18 Years and Over, by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin” from their website for each year between 2012 and 2021. And data sets that include the education attainment data for “Black Alone” is extracted for our project.\nEach worksheet contains education attainment data for each gender, and across different age groups in the specific year. Specifically, each worksheet contains three tables: Both Sexes, Male and Female. Each table includes 14 rows of different age groups, including “18 years and over”, “18 to 24 years”, “25 years and over”, “25 to 29 years”, “30 to 34 years”, “35 to 39 years”, “40 to 44 years”, “45 to 49 years”, “50 to 54 years”, “55 to 59 years”, “60 to 64 years”, “65 to 69 years”, “70 to 74 years”, and “ 75 years and over.” Each table contains 16 columns of different types of education attainment, including: “Total,” “None,” “1st - 4th grade,” “5th - 6th grade,” “7th - 8th grade,” “9th grade,” “10th grade,” “11th grade /2,” “High school graduate,” “Some college no degree,” “Associate’s degree,” “occupational,” “Associate’s degree,” “academic Bachelor’s degree,” “Master’s degree,” “Professional degree,” and “Doctoral degree.”\nWe downloaded 10 worksheets between 2012 and 2021. We plan to import them all into our repositories and write code to combine data from 2012 to 2021. Thus, after some manipulations, we will have one large data set with two new columns to specify gender and year.\nWe attached the link of our data source for each year between 2012 to 2021 below: 2012: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2012/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html 2013: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2013/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html 2014: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2014/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html 2015: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2015/demo/education-attainment/p20-578.html 2016: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2016/demo/education-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html 2017: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/education-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html 2018: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/education-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html 2019: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2019/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html 2020: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html 2021: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html"

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\nThe raw data we have acquired is already subdivided by gender and age ranges. To address our research questions effectively, we will need to develop additional methods to segment this data. This approach will allow us to create targeted plots from these refined subsets, providing clear and direct visual answers to our research inquiries. Here is how we use the data to answer the research questions:\n\nHow has the percentage of black male and female individuals with a Bachelor’s degree or higher changed from the decade of discussion? (Trend in Higher Education) How has the percentage of black male and female individuals with no education changed over the decade? (Trend in No Education History)\n\nTrend in Higher Education: for male and female, sum up columns after Bachelor’s degree as numerator and use total population as denominator to produce year to year percentage; use bar or line plot to show trend and amount. Trend in No Education History:similarly sum up the column of none education as numerator and use total population as denominator to produce year to year non-education percentage; use bar or line plot to show trend and amount.\n\nWhat’s the trend for black males and females to have received a Doctoral degree over the decade for different age groups? (Doctoral Degree across Different Age Groups)\n\nDoctoral Degree across Different Age Groups: get all data under the column Doctoral Degree; use heat map where the y-axis shows age groups and x-axis shows years; each square on the heat map represent number of people who have earned a Doctoral degree from a specific age group and year.\n\nHow do black males and females differ in percentages in education attainments? Can we find patterns from a year to year comparison? (Year to Year Education Attainment Comparison)\n\nYear to Year Education Attainment Comparison: get proportion of above and below Bachelor’s degree for both male and female each year and put together the ten years by using ten simple mosaic plots.\n\nOverall, how would one best describe the different paths in education development between black males and females over the ten year window? (Overall Education Development)\n\nOverall Education Development:(a)segment the male and female population into different education levels; present each segment as an area in an area plot. (b)compare data from 2012 and data from 2021 to see how age groups from the two year are distributed differently across different education attainment; use a parallel ordinate plot in which lines are color-coded by years to check for clusters and patterns.\n\nDuring the time of COVID, were there drastic/noticeable patterns in education attainments? (COVID Impact on Education Attainment)\n\nCOVID Impact on Education Attainment: calculate proportion of education level above and below Bachelor’s degree for years before COVID (2012-2019) and after COVID(2020-2021); plot proportion on a mosaic plot\n\nWhat do our plots implicate for the socio-economic dynamics of the United States? Or what potential policy direction is hinted at if there is any?\n\nThis question serves as a concluding question that we answer by aggregating our conclusion from previous plots."

    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this missing value analysis, we analyze missing values for data sets not limited to “Black only” data sets for a better understanding for patterns in missing values. Missing values across data from all race renders a better idea of why certain data is missing despite missing values from the “Black only” data sets are scarce. Here, we provided three heatmaps: “Missing Data Heatmap - Both Sexes”, “Missing Data Heatmap - Male”, “Missing Data Heatmap - Female.” Each heatmap summarize the missing data from all 60 data frame with the following logic: if there is a missing value in one dataframe in a particular entry (Doctoral Degree & 18 to 24 years), the heatmap will add 1, and we loop through all 60 data frame to add up the number of missing value for each entry. To further explain, each heatmap contains the missing values from 2012 to 2021 for all races in each entry.\nIn our circumstances, a missing value may indicate that the Bureau didn’t collect any data of a particular entry. Another case is that number of people in an entry is less than 1000, so that the Bureau didn’t give a value for that entry because the entry less than 1000 will have a value of zero (the units in the original table is 1000).\nIn all three heatmaps, we can observe that there are lots of missing values for Doctoral degree and Professional degree for the year group of 18 to 24. This is reasonable because doctoral degree and professional degree took longer time to be granted, so that only a small group of people (less than 1000), which may produce a missing data. Besides, there are a small proportion of missing values in the up right corner of heatmaps for Male and Female, which is also reasonable because fewer people in the period of World War 2 may get a Doctoral or Professional Degree.\nThere are also consistent huge proportions of missing values in area below 12th grade for all age groups, indicating that a lot of people didn’t have a chance to go to high school across all years."

From the plot, we observed a clear upward trend in the percentage of both black males and black females attaining a bachelor’s degree or higher over the decade. This suggests improvements in higher educational attainment levels for both genders in the last decades in the black community.\nThroughout the entire period, black females consistently show a higher percentage of attaining a bachelor’s degree or higher compared to black males. This indicates that black females may have more access to higher education, or there may be factors that enable higher educational attainment among females in the black community.\nThe gap between the genders appears to be consistent or slightly widening over the years. The plot does not show any convergence between the genders; instead, the distance between the two lines suggests that the rate of increase in educational attainment may be slightly higher for black females than for black males."

However, from 2015 to 2020, black female have higher percentages of having no education history compared to black males. This may indicate that black males are more likely to engage in educational opportunities than females since 2015.\nHowever, black female have a lower percentages of having no education history compared to black males in 2021. Besides, comparing to data in 2020, black females have a huge decrease in percentages of having no education history while black males have a huge increase in percentages of having no education history. Thus, we speculates that the women may continuously having a lower percentages of having no education history while black males may have an opposite trend.\nBesides, we noticed that the percentages are quite small (less than 0.5%), which indicates that the vast majority of individuals have some educational history."

For both males and females, there seems to be a general increase in the number of individuals with a doctoral degree as the years progress. This trend may indicate an overall improvement in the pursuit of higher education within the black community. While both genders show an increase, the patterns of attainment differ between males and females. Females seem to have a more consistent increase across age groups, whereas males have more pronounced peaks in certain age groups and years such as 2021/50 to 54 years or 2017/30 to 34 years."

Can we find patterns from a year to year comparison?\nWe created a group of mosaic plot for each year to explore this research question. From the plot, we observed that the proportion of individuals with below a bachelor’s degree is higher than those with a bachelor’s degree or higher for both genders from 2012 to 2021. This indicates that the majority within both gender groups have not attained a bachelor’s level education.\nWhile both genders show a similar pattern, there are disparities in the proportion of education attainment between males and females. In all years from 2012 to 2021, the proportion of females with a bachelor’s degree or higher is consistently larger than that of males. This observation is consistent with what we saw from the line plot, suggesting that black females are achieving higher education degrees at a higher rate than black males. In other words, there is a relationship between the possibility of attaining higher education (Bachelor’s Degree or higher) with gender.\nLastly, the gap between the proportion of individuals with and without a bachelor’s degree or higher remains significant for both genders, which indicates a persistent educational attainment gap within the black community."

For this question, we focused on the age groups of “18 to 24 years”, “25 to 29 years”, and “30 to 34 years” to better understand the impact of Covid on the education attainment.\nFrom the graph, we observe that the proportion of individuals with “Bachelor’s Degree or higher” appears to have increased during pandemic comparing to the period before the pandemic. This suggest that there was a notable effect of the pandemic on education attainment levels. This could be attributed to various factors, such as increased availability of online education, changes in job market demands, or a shift in priorities during the pandemic."

For both males and females, the proportion of those with less than a high school education has decreased over the ten years, which indicates an improvement in basic educational attainment. The proportion of individuals with a high school education or some college has remained relatively stable for both genders. The most significant difference appears in the proportion of individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher. For females, there’s a visible increase in this category, suggesting that more black females are attaining higher education degrees over time. The proportion for males also increases, although the increase does not appear as obvious as that for females.\nFrom these observations, we conclude that both black males and females have made progress in educational attainment over the past decade. However, females has a faster rate of increase in higher education (bachelor’s degree or higher) than males. This could suggest that while both genders are valuing education more, females might be having more success or opportunities in reaching the highest levels of educational attainment.\n\n\n3.6.2 Parallel Coordinate Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question: Overall, how would one best describe the different paths in education development between black males and females over the ten year window?\nWe created two parallel coordinate plots for both gender to explore this research question.

On the other hand, the lines are mixing for the number of High school graduate, indicating that the non-higher education doesn’t improve over the last decades.\nOn the other hand, notice that the lines for females appear much more scattered compared to males especially for the Master’s degree. Across different age groups, while male across each age group tend to have very similar number of Master’s degree holders, female age groups differ a lot in terms of the number of Master’s degree holders. This is a direct indicator of the different development in higher education in black female as compared to man."

They can remove Male, Female or Both Genders. Notice that the audience can select multiple years to remove.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The analysis of various data visualizations over a decade has provided significant insights into the educational attainment trends among black men and women. The main takeaway is the notable progress in higher education within the black community, with a particular emphasis on the increasing rates of bachelor’s and higher degrees among both genders. However, a critical observation is the consistent and, in some cases, widening gap between black men and women, with women generally achieving higher levels of education.\nFuture directions should focus on understanding and addressing the underlying factors contributing to these gender disparities in educational attainment. Efforts must be directed towards ensuring equitable access to higher education for both black men and women, and exploring the reasons behind the different educational paths. This includes investigating the role of socioeconomic factors, support systems, and institutional barriers. Additionally, the impact of evolving educational methodologies, like online learning, should be further explored, especially in the context of their potential to democratize higher education access. Overall, while progress is evident, there is a clear need for continued support and strategic initiatives to bridge the educational gaps and foster comprehensive advancement in the black community’s educational achievements.\nHowever, there are some considerate limitation to the plots and their respective interpretation. First, the plots have a focus on the black data set, which results in very little vertical comparison such as a comparison between white male and black male. Besides the lack of reference to other races, another significant concern is the challenge in distinguishing correlation from causation; observed trends in educational attainment might not fully reveal the underlying causes, particularly the complex socio-economic and cultural factors at play. Additionally, the temporal scope of the data limits the ability to understand long-term trends, while the impact of external events like the pandemic may not be comprehensively captured. The choice of visualizations and their interpretation can also heavily influence conclusions, potentially overlooking subtleties in the data. Addressing these limitations is crucial for a more accurate and nuanced understanding of educational trends within the black community."
