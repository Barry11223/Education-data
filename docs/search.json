    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nData used in this project is published by the United States Census Bureau, detailing the population’s education attainment across different race, gender, and age groups. We aim to use the education attainment data from 2012 to 2021 to delve into trends in education, dissecting the evolution of education in the last decade by examining various demographic segments.\nEducation is fundamentally significant for a person’s development in the society. An overview of educational status of a particular subset of the society thus offers lenses through which we can understand broader socio-economic dynamics and challenges. By analyzing the education attainment data, we can identify patterns and disparities in educational access and achievement among different demographic groups. This understanding can inform policy decisions, educational reforms, and targeted initiatives aimed at reducing educational inequalities and fostering a more inclusive and equitable society. Additionally, this analysis can highlight the progress or lack thereof in educational attainment, serving as a critical indicator of the nation’s development and its ability to adapt to the demands of an ever-evolving global economy.\nSome interesting questions we seek to answer through our data visualizations:\n\nHow has the educational attainment varied across different age groups over the last decade? (This question, of course, can be further explored with implication of gender and race)\nWhich variables (age, gender, or race) play a statistically significant role in education attainment?\nHow has education of the high school level, the undergraduate level and other degrees changed across the decade at discussion?\nThroughout the ten years, which race underwent the greatest change in education attainment? What does this implicate for the socio-economic dynamics of the United States?\nDuring the time of COVID, were there drastic/noticeable changes in education attainment?\nWhat do our plots implicate for the socio-economic dynamics of the United States? Or what potential policy direction is hinted at if there is any?"

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe raw data we have acquired is already categorized by race, with further subdivisions by gender and age ranges within each racial group. To address our research questions effectively, we will need to develop additional methods to segment this data. This approach will allow us to create targeted plots from these refined subsets, providing clear and direct visual answers to our research inquiries. Here is how we use the data to answer the research questions:\n\nHow has the educational attainment varied across different age groups over the last decade?\n\nSubset the data by educational attainments; for each education attainment and a specific age range, get a data subset of how a range group’s specific education attainment changes across ten years\n\nWhich variables (age, gender, or race) play a statistically significant role in education attainment?\n\nCreate three separate subsets: one for each variable (age, gender, race). Within each subset, organize the data by different levels of educational attainment.\n\nHow has education of the high school level, the undergraduate level and other degrees changed across the decade at discussion?\n\nGroup the data by education attainment: within each attainment category, get the total population that belong to that category in each year of the ten years.\n\nThroughout the ten years, which race underwent the greatest change in education attainment? What does this implicate for the socio-economic dynamics of the United States?\n\nUse data that pertains to different races. Compare the distribution across different education attainment in each age range.\n\nDuring the time of COVID, were there drastic/noticeable changes in education attainment?\n\nFocus on the data from the years just before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Create subsets for each of these time periods and compare them to identify any significant changes in educational attainment that might be attributed to the pandemic’s impact.\n\nWhat do our plots implicate for the socio-economic dynamics of the United States? Or what potential policy direction is hinted at if there is any?\n\nThis question serves as a concluding question that we answer by aggregating our conclusion from previous plots."

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we provided three heatmaps: “Missing Data Heatmap - Both Sexes”, “Missing Data Heatmap - Male”, “Missing Data Heatmap - Female.” Each heatmap summarize the missing data from all 60 data frame with the following logic: if there is a missing value in one dataframe in a particular entry (Doctoral Degree & 18 to 24 years), the heatmap will add 1, and we loop through all 60 data frame to add up the number of missing value for each entry. To further explain, each heatmap contains the missing values from 2012 to 2021 for all races in each entry.\nIn our circumstances, a missing value may indicate that the Bureau didn’t collect any data of a particular entry. Another case is that number of people in an entry is less than 1000, so that the Bureau didn’t give a value for that entry because the entry less than 1000 will have a value of zero (the units in the original table is 1000).\nIn all three heatmaps, we can observe that there are lots of missing values for Doctoral degree and Professional degree for the year group of 18 to 24. This is reasonable because doctoral degree and professional degree took longer time to be granted, so that only a small group of people (less than 1000), which may produce a missing data. Besides, there are a small proportion of missing values in the up right corner of heatmaps for Male and Female, which is also reasonable because fewer people in the period of World War 2 may get a Doctoral or Professional Degree.\nThere are also consistent huge proportions of missing values in area below 12th grade for all age groups, indicating that a lot of people didn’t have a chance to go to high school across all years."

This suggests improvements in higher educational attainment levels for both genders in the last decades in the black community.\nThroughout the entire period, black females consistently show a higher percentage of attaining a bachelor’s degree or higher compared to black males. This indicates that black females may have more access to higher education, or there may be factors that enable higher educational attainment among females in the black community.\nThe gap between the genders appears to be consistent or slightly widening over the years. The plot does not show any convergence between the genders; instead, the distance between the two lines suggests that the rate of increase in educational attainment may be slightly higher for black females than for black males."

However, from 2015 to 2020, black female have higher percentages of having no education history compared to black males.\nIn this part, we created an interactive D3 graph for the grouped bar chart we discussed in the last section. In the webpage, the audience can remove bars from the plot for any years and gender. The audience can engage by selecting both the years and the gender group they want to remove. They can remove Male, Female or Both Genders. Notice that the audience can select multiple years to remove. If they select Year to be 2012 and 2013 and gender to be Male for example, the interactive plot will not show bars for Male in 2012 and 2013 in the new plot.\nOur goal here is to give the audience the freedom to select the years and gender and saw the corresponding trends for smaller groups of bars. To further explain, some audience may only want to see the bar from 2015 to 2020 and they can achieve this by following the instructions above. By doing so, the audience may gain a better understanding of the percentage of black male and female individuals with no education changed over the decade."

For both males and females, there seems to be a general increase in the number of individuals with a doctoral degree as the years progress. This trend may indicate an overall improvement in the pursuit of higher education within the black community. While both genders show an increase, the patterns of attainment differ between males and females.

From the plot, we observed that the proportion of individuals with below a bachelor’s degree is higher than those with a bachelor’s degree or higher for both genders from 2012 to 2021. This indicates that the majority within both gender groups have not attained a bachelor’s level education.\nWhile both genders show a similar pattern, there are disparities in the proportion of education attainment between males and females. In all years from 2012 to 2021, the proportion of females with a bachelor’s degree or higher is consistently larger than that of males. This observation is consistent with what we saw from the line plot, suggesting that black females are achieving higher education degrees at a higher rate than black males. In other words, there is a relationship between the possibility of attaining higher education (Bachelor’s Degree or higher) with gender.\nLastly, the gap between the proportion of individuals with and without a bachelor’s degree or higher remains significant for both genders, which indicates a persistent educational attainment gap within the black community."

This suggest that there was a notable effect of the pandemic on education attainment levels. This could be attributed to various factors, such as increased availability of online education, changes in job market demands, or a shift in priorities during the pandemic."

For both males and females, the proportion of those with less than a high school education has decreased over the ten years, which indicates an improvement in basic educational attainment. The proportion of individuals with a high school education or some college has remained relatively stable for both genders. The most significant difference appears in the proportion of individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher. For females, there’s a visible increase in this category, suggesting that more black females are attaining higher education degrees over time. The proportion for males also increases, although the increase does not appear as obvious as that for females.\nFrom these observations, we conclude that both black males and females have made progress in educational attainment over the past decade. However, females has a faster rate of increase in higher education (bachelor’s degree or higher) than males. This could suggest that while both genders are valuing education more, females might be having more success or opportunities in reaching the highest levels of educational attainment.\n\n\n3.6.2 Parallel Coordinate Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question: Overall, how would one best describe the different paths in education development between black males and females over the ten year window?\nWe created two parallel coordinate plots for both gender to explore this research question.

On the other hand, the lines are mixing for the number of High school graduate, indicating that the non-higher education doesn’t improve over the last decades.\nOn the other hand, notice that the lines for females appear much more scattered compared to males especially for the Master’s degree. Across different age groups, while male across each age group tend to have very similar number of Master’s degree holders, female age groups differ a lot in terms of the number of Master’s degree holders. This is a direct indicator of the different development in higher education in black female as compared to man."
