This project analyzes U.S. Census Bureau data from 2012 to 2021 to study trends in educational attainment across race, gender, and age groups. 

The goal is to identify trends and disparities in education levels over the last decade, providing insights into how education has evolved in the United States.

By exploring the impact of variables such as age, gender, and race on educational attainment, the project seeks to uncover socio-economic dynamics and trend, social development across different groups of people, and possibly inform potential policy directions.
